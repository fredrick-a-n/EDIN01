Exercise 1: Assume that we can perform ten million tests of the above kind each second on our computer. How long would it take to factor a 25 digit number (with two prime factors both of the same order (12 digit numbers))?


Exercise 2: How much faster does your improved trial division algorithm become for 25 digit numbers? Roughly how much storage does your algorithm require? What kind of budget does the storage requirement demand; student budget, big government grant, more dollars than there are atoms in the universe?
