Exercise 1: Assume that we can perform ten million tests of the above kind each second on our computer. How long would it take to factor a 25 digit number (with two prime factors both of the same order (12 digit numbers))?

500 000 000 000
10 000 000/s
5000s?

at least 1000 s
Average of all 12 digit primes divided by 10 000 000. Approximatly 5000

Average first prime of 12 digit numbers? 

33 489 857 205 primes with 12 digits.
100 000 000 000 -- 999 999 999 999 
900 000 000 000

P(k = n) = 1 / 33489857205


If you randomly select 2 12 digit primes, what is the smallest one of them on average?





Exercise 2: How much faster does your improved trial division algorithm become for 25 digit numbers? Roughly how much storage does your algorithm require? What kind of budget does the storage requirement demand; student budget, big government grant, more dollars than there are atoms in the universe?
